 Hunger Maze
 This is a 1-player game. Hunger Games, was a film/book that inspired me to initiate this game. The player would be a Tribute, and a Victor if they get to the goal of the maze!

How To Play: This game is a timed one-player game meaning that you have to be quick with your tapping! You have four tam movements in the Hunger Maze; up, right, down,and left. You start from the beginning of the maze and navigate your way through to the goal. What is the goal you ask? Well just quite like the opposite in the Hunger Games, the berries were used as a way to defy President Snow, but rather this berry (Strawberry) will grant you the chance to become the newfound Victor! It is timed, so if you don't reach on time or before the time is up, you lose!

Every time you play you will have exactly 10 seconds, nothing less and nothing more on this prescious time. 

May the odds be ever in your favor!
